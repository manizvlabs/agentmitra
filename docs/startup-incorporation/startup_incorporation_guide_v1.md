# Startup Company Incorporation Guide (India)

## 📌 Registration Type Recommendation
- **Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd)** – best for startups, investor friendly, limited liability.  
- Alternatives: LLP (less compliance, but less investor-friendly).  

## 📊 Taxes
- Corporate Tax: 22% (domestic companies, if no exemptions) OR 25% with exemptions.  
- Startups with < 25 Cr turnover may get tax holiday (Sec 80-IAC) for 3 years.  
- GST applicable if annual turnover > ₹40L (services ₹20L).  
- No tax liability if no income/profit (but compliance filings mandatory).  

## ™️ IP & Trademark
- **Logo & Name**: Register Trademark under **TM-A**.  
- **Software/IP**: Add IP ownership clause in Founders Agreement + Client Contracts.
