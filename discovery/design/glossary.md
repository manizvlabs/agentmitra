# Agent Mitra Glossary

## Separation of Concerns

**Separation of Concerns** refers to the architectural principle of dividing a software system into distinct sections, each addressing a specific concern or responsibility. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### Key Components in Agent Mitra Architecture

* **Agent Mitra Mobile App**: Customer-facing Flutter application for policy management, premium payments, and service requests
* **Agent Mitra Config Portal/Website**: Agent-facing web portal for data management, reporting, and administrative functions
* **Official LIC Systems**: Existing LIC infrastructure that Agent Mitra integrates with for core insurance operations

### Benefits of Separation of Concerns

1. **Modularity**: Each component can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
2. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled based on their specific requirements
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Each component can use the most appropriate technology stack
5. **Security**: Different security models can be applied based on component requirements

### Integration Points

- Mobile App ↔ Config Portal: Data synchronization and agent assignment
- Config Portal ↔ LIC Systems: Policy data, premium processing, and reporting
- Mobile App ↔ LIC Systems: Direct integration for real-time policy information and transactions
