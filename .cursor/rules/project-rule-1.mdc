# Project Architecture Standards

- This project uses a clean layered architecture: UI → Service → Repository → API/DB.
- Do not write mock data or stub logic anywhere.
- Do not write SQL schema changes inline inside the service or repository layer.
- All DB schema changes MUST be implemented using **Flyway migrations** under `/db/migration`.
- All client apps (Flutter) must consume **real backend APIs only**.
- Business logic must not be placed in UI files.
- All code must include minimal comments explaining business logic or API integration.
- Always generate models, DTOs, and entities using strict typing and avoid dynamic maps.
- Keep all generated code consistent with the existing folder structure.
