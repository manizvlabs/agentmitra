# Flutter UI Coding Rules

## API Integration
- Never create mock data inside widgets, view models, controllers, or providers.
- Every screen must load its data from a **real backend API** using the correct domain service.
- Always parse API responses into typed model classes (no Map<String, dynamic> used directly).
- Always use repository/service layers for data retrieval, not direct `http` calls inside widgets.

## UI/State Management
- UI files must only contain widget code; state must be in controller/provider/BLoC.
- Do not put business logic inside UI widgets.
- Screen must handle loading, success, and error states cleanly.
- Use domain models, not raw JSON, inside UI layer.

## Code Structure
- Place screens in `lib/screens/`.
- Place models in `lib/models/`.
- Place API/repo/services under `lib/services/`.
- Keep file names consistent: `<feature>_screen.dart`, `<feature>_service.dart`, `<feature>_model.dart`.
